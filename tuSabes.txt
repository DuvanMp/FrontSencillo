Hi Hristiyan,

Thank you for reaching out and for sharing the details about the opportunity.

I’m particularly interested in the **Backend Software Engineer** role, as it aligns well with my experience in C#/.NET, SQL Server, and distributed systems.

I’ve scheduled the call for **tomorrow at 8:30 AM (Colombia time)** and I’m looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you need anything from my side in advance.

Best regards,
Duvan
